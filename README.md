# voronoi_mesh_project
Small C++ Project to generate a voronoi mesh in the most naive way possible. Still work in progress...

### Later on
- Benachmarking (Debug and Release Version)
- Improve performance (do profiling)
- Correctness checks
- Add a volume calculation
- Other algorithms and comparison...
